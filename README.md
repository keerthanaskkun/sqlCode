# Employee Management - SQL

This SQL script creates a small employee management database.  
I used it to practice table creation, inserting data, and writing queries.

## What‚Äôs included
- Creates a database called `EmployeeDB`
- Two tables: `Employee` and `Department`
- Sample records for both tables
- Example queries to:
  - List employees with their department names
  - Find the highest-paid person in each department
  - Show employees hired after 2022
  - Calculate average salary per department

## How to run
1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL database tool
2. Copy all the commands from `employee_management.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor and run the script

You should see the tables created and results when running the example queries.
